# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

This project was created by: Adam Conner

## Functionality

Clicking on the joke text will generate a new joke. As will selecting a category and clicking on "new joke"

If you click ont the disk icon it will save the joke to a list.

If you toggle Show Saved, it will show all jokes and their categories that you've saved thus far.

The same joke cannot be saved more than once.

When you have saved jokes visible, you can delete them individually by clicking on the red x

You can also click the pencil to enable editing of that one jokes text content. When complete, clicking checkmark
will save those changes to the object in your savedJokes array.


## Timeline

### Thursday, March 10:

I first opened any video or website related to React.

I built a basic React App using Use State varaibles to help learn React basics

### Friday, March 11:

I received the test task to complete. Once looking at the list of requiremenets I decided I would tackle everything using usestate varaibles first (this was a bit of a mistake)

### Saturday March 12 - Saturday March 19th:

## Known Bugs

The css is not super mobile or small screen friendly. My edit/delete icons are using fixed padding/margins which is causing the issue.
